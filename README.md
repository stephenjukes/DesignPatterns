# DesignPatterns

This repository shows the code I have written to practice a number of design patterns. Most of them are recreations of the code written by [Christopher Okhravi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ejT8FO-7I&list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc) on his youtube channel. View the code in the folders above or see how the code works in any of the links below. Each link will take you to repl.it and code can be run by pressing 'run' or \[ctrl\] + Enter.

* [Adapter Pattern](https://repl.it/@dukies_2000/AdapterPattern) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _adapts a two pin plug class to a three pin socket class_
* [Bridge Pattern](https://repl.it/@dukies_2000/BridgePattern) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _enders an artist, band or song page to full, medium or short view_
* [Command Pattern](https://repl.it/@dukies_2000/CommandPattern) &nbsp;&nbsp; _uses remote control buttons to control a light_
